save the best for last
the sun is shining
coder for life
i like how you think
strive for greatness
no pain no gain
broken crayons still color
impossible is for the unwilling
when nothing goes right go left
you only live once
the best is yet to come
shine like the stars
Good To The Last Drop
work smarter not harder
All that is gold does not glitter
Not all those who wander are lost
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good
to be or not to be
Time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time
you learn more from failure than success
fake it until you make it
fail early fail often
